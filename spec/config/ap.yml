# Copy this file and change the following settings:
# 1. whitelist
# 2. dor fetcher service_url
# 3. solr url
# 4. harvestdor log_dir, log_nam


# whitelist:  which objects will you index?
# the whitelist can be
#   1. an array of druids inline here, e.g. ['druid:oo123oo1234', 'druid:oo234oo2345']
#   2. a filename containing a list of druids (one per line)
# if a druid is for a collection record (per the object's identityMetadata at purl page)
#  then we process all the item druids in that collection (as if they were included individually in the whitelist)
# if a druid is for an item object, then we process that druid
#whitelist: ['druid:dq441rn2614']
#  either give absolute path or path relative to where the command will be executed
#whitelist: config/ap_whitelist.txt

dor_fetcher:
  # the baseurl of the DOR Fetcher service from which we get the item druids (per whitelist above)
  #  do not include 'collections' at end.
  service_url: http://127.0.0.1:3000
  # if skip_heartbeat set to true, this will skip a check that the dorfetcher service is alive before making API calls
  #   (useful for testing)
  skip_heartbeat: true

# ----------- SOLR index (that we're writing INTO) parameters ------------
solr:
  url: https://solr.baseurl.org
  # timeouts are in seconds;  read_timeout -> open/read, open_timeout -> connection open
  read_timeout: 20
  open_timeout: 20
  max_retries: 3

harvestdor:
  # log_name: name of log file  (default: STDERR per harvestdor-indexer)
  log_name: ap-test.log

  # log_dir:  directory for log file  (suggest: logs)
  log_dir: spec/test_logs

  # purl: url for the DOR purl server (used to get ContentMetadata, etc.)
  purl: https://purl.stanford.edu

  # Additional options to pass to Faraday http client (https://github.com/technoweenie/faraday)
